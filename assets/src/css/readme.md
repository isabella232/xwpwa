# CSS

## Working with scss files

To watching the scss files and generate the main.min.css file into `assets/dist/css` run `npm run css`.

Node 8 must be used, by using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)
`nvm install 8`
`nvm use 8`

You may need to install `node-sass` for the version 10 of node with the command:
`npm rebuild node-sass`

## Structure of the CSS folder

### Helpers

#### scss-query

This package will be used for @media queries.

#### Colors variables

All the colors used throughout the site must set as variable in that file.
These colors variables are used inside the maps to create the `color` and `background` classes.
The current variables are only an indication and must be updated from the design value.

#### Mixins

The location for the scss mixins

#### Typography

Some reset for the font-weight and some style for the loading fonts.

The `color` classes are generated from that file, with a mixin and map.
The map must use the color variables coming from the color file.
The **colors map** and the **color variables** are set as an example and must be updated with the value coming from the design.
The goal of the `color-xxx` classes is to add the color to each text element inside the HTML and not as a CSS property.
The name will be based on the map and the output will be like `color-primary` or `color-grey-100`

From the same logic, this file will generate the `text-xxx` classes.
Based on a map of the font sized used inside the site, multiple classes will be generated.

So a text element will be like that in the HTML:   `<h1 class="color-primary text-xx-large">Title</h1>`

#### Background

This file is used to generated the different classes used to set the background color of an element.
So the element will be like:  `<section class="bg-primary">â€¦</section>`

#### Variables

Breakpoints, Z-Index named layers, easings, transition

### Base

#### Global

The reset is done in that file.

#### wp-core

Some default style for Wordpress are also available.

### Components

Components classes are prefixed with `c-`

#### logo

### Layouts

Layout classes are prefixed with `l-`

#### Header
